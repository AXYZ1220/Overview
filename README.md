## Assignments

Assignments will be completed on [datahub.ucsd.edu](datahub.ucsd.edu).

To complete your first assignment (**A1**), you'll need to read and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview/A1_Setup.pdf). The remaining assignments will all be self-contained on [datahub.ucsd.edu](datahub.ucsd.edu).

## Readings

A suggested [reading list](https://github.com/COGS108/Readings) (recommended, but not required).

## Final Projects

A core component of the class is completing a group project. Some example projects from the [Sp17](https://github.com/COGS108/FinalProjects) and [Wi18](https://github.com/COGS108/FinalProjects-Wi18) iterations of the class are available.

## A reminder about time: 

These assignments are intermingled with your project proposal (due W2) and final project (due finals week). This is an assignment-heavy course load to get you as much practice as possible. This will require good time management and planning on your part. Start planning ahead now to avoid late submissions and issues later in the quarter.
